Description: A set of functions for organising and analysing datasets from
    experiments run using 'Eyelink' eye-trackers. Organising functions help
    to clean and prepare eye-tracking datasets for analysis, and mark up
    key events such as display changes and responses made by participants.
    Analysing functions help to create means for a wide range of standard
    measures (such as 'mean fixation durations'), which can then be fed into
    the appropriate statistical analyses and graphing packages as necessary.
