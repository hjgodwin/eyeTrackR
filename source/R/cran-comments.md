## Resubmission
Thanks for your previous comments.  Here, I have:
  
* Changed the title in the DESCRIPTION file to title case
* Put single quotes around software names in the DESCRIPTION file (these are 'DataViewer' and 'Eyelink')
* Dropped 'Functions for' from the Title field, so the title is now 'Organising and Analysing Eye-Tracking Data'
* In the previous submission, I was asked if we could add a reference to the Description. At present, there is not a reference to point to, but I am working on writing one and will cite it once it is available online.
