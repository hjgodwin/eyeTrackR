# eyeTrackR

R package for analysing eye-tracking data. 

Please head over to: http://hjgodwin.github.io/eyeTrackR/ for a guide.

# Detailed Description

A set of functions for organising and analysing datasets from experiments run using 'Eyelink' eye-trackers. Organising functions help to clean and prepare eye-tracking datasets for analysis, and mark up key events such as display changes and responses made by participants. Analysing functions help to create means for a wide range of standard measures (such as 'mean fixation durations'), which can then be fed into the appropriate statistical analyses and graphing packages as necessary.

# What's new in eyeTrackR 1.1

The main headline features of eyeTrackR 1.1 are:
- PROJECTS! Projects allow you to organise your data, code and analyses and make it easier to share your work with others. They can focus on a single dataset, but, more importantly, can encompass multiple datasets from different studies. You can run a single analysis or function across multiple datasets all in one go.
- PIPELINES! A key feature of projects are data processing pipelines, which, with more and more complex datasets, become more and more important. You can save your pipelines as simple .yaml files and then run them. Suppose that you want to send your pipeline to someone else - the simple task becomes one of sharing your pipeline file and you're set.

# Welcome to the DEVELOPMENT ZONE

Here we do testing and updates. There's a set of slides available at the link below which mostly comprises my own notes about the new in development version of eyeTrackR.

Please feel free to let us know what you think. You can do this via email, via the twitters, or by commenting directly on the slides themselves.
