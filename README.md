# eyeTrackR

R package for analysing eye-tracking data. 

Please head over to: http://hjgodwin.github.io/eyeTrackR/ for a guide.

# Detailed Description

A set of functions for organising and analysing datasets from experiments run using 'Eyelink' eye-trackers. Organising functions help to clean and prepare eye-tracking datasets for analysis, and mark up key events such as display changes and responses made by participants. Analysing functions help to create means for a wide range of standard measures (such as 'mean fixation durations'), which can then be fed into the appropriate statistical analyses and graphing packages as necessary.

# Welcome to the **DEVELOPMENT ZONE**

Here we do testing and updates. There are two branches of work going on here - one that will be completed in the short term, and one that will take a bit longer. The one that will be completed in the short term is eyeTrackR 1.0.5, which introduces the ability to work on data from reading experiments. The one that will be completed in the longer term is eyeTrackR 1.1, which introduces many new features.

# What will be new in **eyeTrackR 1.0.5**

The main headline features of eyeTrackR 1.0.5 are:
- **READING!** Functions to create standard measures for eye movements and reading studies. These are a hugely popular approach.
- **MAKING READING STIMULI** Functions to create stimuli for eye movements and reading experiments. This avoids some of the time-consuming tasks that people face when making reading experiments using Experiment Builder.

# What will be new in **eyeTrackR 1.1**

The main headline features of eyeTrackR 1.1 are:
- **PROJECTS!** Projects allow you to organise your data, code and analyses and make it easier to share your work with others. They can focus on a single dataset, but, more importantly, can encompass multiple datasets from different studies. You can run a single analysis or function across multiple datasets all in one go.
- **PIPELINES!** A key feature of projects are data processing pipelines, which, with more and more complex datasets, become more and more important. You can save your pipelines as simple .yaml files and then run them. Suppose that you want to send your pipeline to someone else - the simple task becomes one of sharing your pipeline file and you're set.

There's a set of slides available at the link below which mostly comprises my own notes about the new in development version of eyeTrackR.

Please feel free to let us know what you think. You can do this via email, via the twitters, or by commenting directly on the slides themselves.
