# Detailed Description

A set of functions for organising and analysing datasets from experiments run using 'Eyelink' eye-trackers. Organising functions help to clean and prepare eye-tracking datasets for analysis, and mark up key events such as display changes and responses made by participants. Analysing functions help to create means for a wide range of standard measures (such as 'mean fixation durations'), which can then be fed into the appropriate statistical analyses and graphing packages as necessary.
