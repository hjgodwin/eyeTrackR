## Installing via Devtools

From R using the **devtools** package:

```{r, eval=F}
library(devtools)
install_github('hjgodwin/eyetrackR/source')
```

## Removing eyeTrackR

If you want to remove the package either to update it or because you just want to get rid of it, run the following from R:

remove.packages(pkgs="eyeTrackR")
```
