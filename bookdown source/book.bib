abstract = {Previous research has shown that during visual search tasks target prevalence (the proportion of trials in which a target appears) influences both the probability that a target will be detected, and the speed at which participants will quit searching and provide an 'absent' response. When prevalence is low (e.g., target presented on 2 {\%} of trials), participants are less likely to detect the target than when prevalence is higher (e.g., 50 {\%} of trials). In the present set of experiments, we examined perceptual failures to detect low prevalence targets in visual search. We used a relative prevalence search task in order to be able to present an overall 50 {\%} target prevalence and thereby prevent the results being accounted for by early quitting behavior. Participants searched for two targets, one of which appeared on 45 {\%} of trials and another that appeared on 5 {\%} of trials, leaving overall target prevalence at 50 {\%}. In the first experiment, participants searched for two dissimilar targets; in the second experiment, participants searched for two similar targets. Overall, the results supported the notion that a reduction in prevalence primarily influenced perceptual failures of identification, rather than of selection. Together, these experiments add to a growing body of research exploring how and why observers fail to detect low prevalence targets, especially in real-world tasks in which some targets are more likely to appear than others.},

@article{Riggs2017,
abstract = {A number of real-world search tasks (i.e. police search, detection of improvised explosive devices (IEDs)) require searchers to search exhaustively across open ground. In the present study, we simulated this problem by asking individuals (Experiments 1a and 1b) and dyads (Experiment 2) to search for coin targets pseudo-randomly located in a bounded area of open grassland terrain. In Experiment 1a, accuracy, search time, and the route used to search an area were measured. Participants tended to use an ‘S'-shaped pattern with a common width of search lane. Increased accuracy was associated with slower, but also variable, search speed, though only when participants moved along the length (as opposed to across the width) of the search area. Experiment 1b varied the number of targets available within the bounded search area and in doing so varied target prevalence and density. The results confirmed that the route taken in Experiment 1a generalizes across variations in target prevalence/density. In Experiment 2, accuracy, search time, and the search strategy used by dyads was measured. While dyads were more accurate than individuals, dyads that opted to conduct two independent searches were more accurate than those who opted to split the search space. The implications of these results for individuals and dyads when searching for targets in open space are discussed.},

abstract = {We assessed fixation planning in visual search in two experiments by tracking participants' eye movements while they each searched for a simple target (a T shape) among a set of distractors (L shapes). On some trials, the search display was briefly interrupted with a blank screen and, following a randomly determined period of elapsed time, the search display was reinstated. In Experiment 1, we found that search continued during the interruption but fixation durations were increased and the accuracy of saccadic targeting was impaired. A MLM demonstrated that acuity played a role in determining whether fixated missing objects were processed during the interruption and that fixation planning was uninfluenced by the length of time available prior to the interruption. In Experiment 2, to check that fixations in the interruption periods were not random, half the distractors were blue (the target was blue as well) and half were yellow. All of the findings from Experiment 1 were replicated and the majority of fixations in the interruption period landed upon blue distractors. Results are discussed in relation to the capacity, time course, and format of fixation plans in visual search. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).},

abstract = "A crucial question in cognitive science is how linguistic and visual information are integrated. Previous research has shown that eye movements to objects in the visual environment are locked to linguistic input. More surprisingly, listeners fixate on now-empty regions that had previously been occupied by relevant objects. This ‘looking at nothing’ phenomenon has been linked to the claim that the visual system constructs sparse representations of the external world and relies on saccades and fixations to extract information in a just-in-time manner. Our model provides a different explanation: based on recent work in visual cognition and memory, it assumes that the visual system creates and stores detailed internal memory representations, and that looking at nothing facilitates retrieval of those representations."

abstract = {It has previously been argued that, during visual search, eye movement behavior is indicative of an underlying scanning "strategy" that starts on a global, or "coarse," scale but then progressively focuses to a more local, or "fine," scale. This conclusion is motivated by the finding that, as a trial progresses, fixation durations tend to increase and saccade amplitudes tend to decrease. In the present study, we replicate these effects but offer an alternative explanation for them-that they emerge from a few stochastic factors that control eye movement behavior. We report the results of a simulation supporting this hypothesis and discuss implications for future models of visual search.},

abstract = {Oculomotor behavior contributes importantly to visual search. Saccadic eye movements can direct the fovea to potentially interesting parts of the visual field. Ensuing stable fixations enables the visual system to analyze those parts. The visual system may use fixation duration and saccadic amplitude as optimizers for visual search performance. Here we investigate whether the time courses of fixation duration and saccade amplitude depend on the subject's knowledge of the search stimulus, in particular target conspicuity. We analyzed 65,000 saccades and fixations in a search experiment for (possibly camouflaged) military vehicles of unknown type and size. Mean saccade amplitude decreased and mean fixation duration increased gradually as a function of the ordinal saccade and fixation number. In addition we analyzed 162,000 saccades and fixations recorded during a search experiment in which the location of the target was the only unknown. Whether target conspicuity was constant or varied appeared to have minor influence on the time courses of fixation duration and saccade amplitude. We hypothesize an intrinsic coarse-to-fine strategy for visual search that is even used when such a strategy is not optimal.},
