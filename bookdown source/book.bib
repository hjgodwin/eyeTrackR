abstract = {Previous research has shown that during visual search tasks target prevalence (the proportion of trials in which a target appears) influences both the probability that a target will be detected, and the speed at which participants will quit searching and provide an 'absent' response. When prevalence is low (e.g., target presented on 2 {\%} of trials), participants are less likely to detect the target than when prevalence is higher (e.g., 50 {\%} of trials). In the present set of experiments, we examined perceptual failures to detect low prevalence targets in visual search. We used a relative prevalence search task in order to be able to present an overall 50 {\%} target prevalence and thereby prevent the results being accounted for by early quitting behavior. Participants searched for two targets, one of which appeared on 45 {\%} of trials and another that appeared on 5 {\%} of trials, leaving overall target prevalence at 50 {\%}. In the first experiment, participants searched for two dissimilar targets; in the second experiment, participants searched for two similar targets. Overall, the results supported the notion that a reduction in prevalence primarily influenced perceptual failures of identification, rather than of selection. Together, these experiments add to a growing body of research exploring how and why observers fail to detect low prevalence targets, especially in real-world tasks in which some targets are more likely to appear than others.},

@article{Riggs2017,
abstract = {A number of real-world search tasks (i.e. police search, detection of improvised explosive devices (IEDs)) require searchers to search exhaustively across open ground. In the present study, we simulated this problem by asking individuals (Experiments 1a and 1b) and dyads (Experiment 2) to search for coin targets pseudo-randomly located in a bounded area of open grassland terrain. In Experiment 1a, accuracy, search time, and the route used to search an area were measured. Participants tended to use an â€˜S'-shaped pattern with a common width of search lane. Increased accuracy was associated with slower, but also variable, search speed, though only when participants moved along the length (as opposed to across the width) of the search area. Experiment 1b varied the number of targets available within the bounded search area and in doing so varied target prevalence and density. The results confirmed that the route taken in Experiment 1a generalizes across variations in target prevalence/density. In Experiment 2, accuracy, search time, and the search strategy used by dyads was measured. While dyads were more accurate than individuals, dyads that opted to conduct two independent searches were more accurate than those who opted to split the search space. The implications of these results for individuals and dyads when searching for targets in open space are discussed.},
